               At present, it is unknown how the locations of replication
               origins are determined in the human genome. Here we dissect the
               role of topologically associating domains (TADs)3-6, subTADs7
               and loops8 in the positioning of replication initiation zones
               (IZs). We stratify TADs and subTADs by the presence of
               corner-dots indicative of loops and the orientation of CTCF
               motifs. We find that high-efficiency, early replicating IZs
               localize to boundaries between adjacent corner-dot TADs anchored
               by high-density arrays of divergently and convergently oriented
               CTCF motifs. By contrast, low-efficiency IZs localize to weaker
               dotless boundaries. Following ablation of cohesin-mediated loop
               extrusion during G1, high-efficiency IZs become diffuse and
               delocalized at boundaries with complex CTCF motif orientations.
               Moreover, G1 knockdown of the cohesin unloading factor WAPL
               results in gained long-range loops and narrowed localization of
               IZs at the same boundaries. Finally, targeted deletion or
               insertion of specific boundaries causes local replication timing
               shifts consistent with IZ loss or gain, respectively. Our data

              disease variants. Operations on genomic intervals provide a

              factor controlling their mechanical properties, dynamics and
              function. Recent work has shown that interphase chromosomes are
              largely free of entanglements. How cycling cells establish this
              state from a dense mitotic chromosome and maintain it through
              interphase in the presence of Topoisomerase II activity remains
              mysterious. Using multi-contact 3C, Hi-C, and polymer
              simulations, we find that mitotic chromosomes are
              intrachromosomally entangled, while interphase chromosomes are
              not, pointing to cell cycle-dependent control of chromosome
              topology. The majority of mitotic entanglements are removed
              during anaphase/telophase, with most of the remaining ones
              removed during early G1, in a process that requires Topoisomerase
              II. Polymer simulations show that swelling and decondensation of
              mitotic chromosomes during mitotic exit produce entropic forces
              that bias Topoisomerase II activity towards decatenation of
              condensin loops. This is followed by prevention of formation of
              new entanglements by lower Topoisomerase II activity in G1, and,
              in heterochromatic B compartments, by interplay between cohesin
              and Topoisomerase II. Our results show how cells control
              chromosome topology during mitotic exit and G1 employing both

Recurrent somatic mutations in the cohesin complex are frequent genetic drivers in cancer, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, using genetic dependency screens of stromal antigen 2–mutant (STAG2-mutant) AML, we identified DNA damage repair and replication as genetic dependencies in cohesin-mutant cells. We demonstrated increased levels of DNA damage and sensitivity of cohesin-mutant cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. We developed a mouse model of MDS in which Stag2 mutations arose as clonal secondary lesions in the background of clonal hematopoiesis driven by tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2) mutations and demonstrated selective depletion of cohesin-mutant cells with PARP inhibition in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated a shift from STAG2- to STAG1-containing cohesin complexes in cohesin-mutant cells, which was associated with longer DNA loop extrusion, more intermixing of chromatin compartments, and increased interaction with PARP and replication protein A complex. Our findings inform the biology and therapeutic opportunities for cohesin-mutant malignancies.},

	abstract = {Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion folds interphase chromosomes at the ten to hundreds kilobases scale. This process produces structural features such as loops and topologically associating domains. We identify three types of cis-elements that define the chromatin folding landscape generated by loop extrusion. First, CTCF sites form boundaries by stalling extruding cohesin, as shown before. Second, transcription termination sites form boundaries by acting as cohesin unloading sites. RNA polymerase II contributes to boundary formation at transcription termination sites. Third, transcription start sites form boundaries that are mostly independent of cohesin, but are sites where cohesin can pause. Together with cohesin loading at enhancers, and possibly other cis-elements, these loci create a dynamic pattern of cohesin traffic along the genome that guides enhancer-promoter interactions. Disturbing this traffic pattern, by removing CTCF barriers, renders cells sensitive to knock-out of genes involved in transcription initiation, such as the SAGA and TFIID complexes, and RNA processing such DEAD-Box RNA helicases. In the absence of CTCF, several of these factors fail to be efficiently recruited to active promoters. We propose that the complex pattern of cohesin movement along chromatin contributes to appropriate promoter-enhancer interactions and localization of transcription and RNA processing factors to active genes.HIGHLIGHTSAt least three types of chromatin boundaries regulate a cohesin traffic pattern.The cohesin traffic pattern guides enhancer-promoter interactions.Removing CTCF renders cells sensitive to deletion of RNA processing and gene regulation genes.Depleting CTCF affects localization of RNA processing and gene regulatory proteins.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of early-replicating domains remain largely unknown. We defined two minimal cis-element modules containing a strong replication origin and chromatin modifier binding sites capable of shifting a targeted mid-late-replicating region for earlier replication. The two origins overlap with a constitutive or a silent tissue-specific promoter. When inserted side-by-side, these modules advance replication timing over a 250 kb region through the cooperation with one endogenous origin located 30 kb away. Moreover, when inserted at two chromosomal sites separated by 30 kb, these two modules come into close physical proximity and form an early-replicating domain establishing more contacts with active A compartments. The synergy depends on the presence of the active promoter/origin. Our results show that clustering of strong origins located at active promoters can establish early-replicating domains.},

abstract = {Summary
Over the past decade, 3C-related methods have provided remarkable insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource for studies of chromosome organization.}

  abstract  = "Chromosome folding is modulated as cells progress through the
               cell cycle. During mitosis, condensins fold chromosomes into
               helical loop arrays. In interphase, the cohesin complex
               generates loops and topologically associating domains (TADs),
               while a separate process of compartmentalization drives
               segregation of active and inactive chromatin. We used
               synchronized cell cultures to determine how the mitotic
               chromosome conformation transforms into the interphase state.
               Using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)
               analysis, chromatin binding assays and immunofluorescence, we
               show that, by telophase, condensin-mediated loops are lost and a
               transient folding intermediate is formed that is devoid of most
               loops. By cytokinesis, cohesin-mediated CTCF-CTCF loops and the
               positions of TADs emerge. Compartment boundaries are also
               established early, but long-range compartmentalization is a slow
               process and proceeds for hours after cells enter G1. Our results
               reveal the kinetics and order of events by which the interphase
               chromosome state is formed and identify telophase as a critical
               transition between condensin- and cohesin-driven chromosome

    abstract = { Mammalian cells express two oligosaccharyltransferase complexes, STT3A and STT3B, that have distinct roles in N-linked glycosylation. The STT3A complex interacts directly with the protein translocation channel to mediate glycosylation of proteins using an N-terminal–to–C-terminal scanning mechanism. N-linked glycosylation of proteins in budding yeast has been assumed to be a cotranslational reaction. We have compared glycosylation of several glycoproteins in yeast and mammalian cells. Prosaposin, a cysteine-rich protein that contains STT3A-dependent glycosylation sites, is poorly glycosylated in yeast cells and STT3A-deficient human cells. In contrast, a protein with extreme C-terminal glycosylation sites was efficiently glycosylated in yeast by a posttranslocational mechanism. Posttranslocational glycosylation was also observed for carboxypeptidase Y–derived reporter proteins that contain closely spaced acceptor sites. A comparison of two recent protein structures indicates that the yeast OST is unable to interact with the yeast heptameric Sec complex via an evolutionarily conserved interface due to occupation of the OST binding site by the Sec63 protein. The efficiency of glycosylation in yeast is not enhanced for proteins that are translocated by the Sec61 or Ssh1 translocation channels instead of the Sec complex. We conclude that N-linked glycosylation and protein translocation are not directly coupled in yeast cells. }

The STT3A complex interacts directly with the protein translocation channel to mediate cotranslational glycosylation, while the STT3B complex can catalyze posttranslocational glycosylation. We used a quantitative glycoproteomics procedure to compare glycosylation of roughly 1,000 acceptor sites in wild type and mutant cells. Analysis of site occupancy data disclosed several new classes of STT3A-dependent acceptor sites including those with suboptimal flanking sequences and sites located within cysteine-rich protein domains. Acceptor sites located in short loops of multi-spanning membrane proteins represent a new class of STT3B-dependent site. Remarkably, the lumenal ER chaperone GRP94 was hyperglycosylated in STT3A-deficient cells, bearing glycans on five silent sites in addition to the normal glycosylation site. GRP94 was also hyperglycosylated in wild-type cells treated with ER stress inducers including thapsigargin, dithiothreitol, and NGI-1.}",
